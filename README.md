# Engulfing_candle_backtester
This project is a Python-based backtesting engine for a custom crypto trading strategy that uses RSI, volume EMA, and engulfing candlestick patterns. It calculates risk-managed entries and simulates trades over historical data loaded in either CSV file or from binance.
